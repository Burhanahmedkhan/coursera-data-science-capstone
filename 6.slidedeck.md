Unlocking the power of predictive text
========================================================

KILOS™ Predictive Text unlocks the power of predictive text at your fingertips! 
At least... It unlocks a nice effort and a so-so experience, but it holds a lot of promise, sort of.. a bit.. well at least I tried.

KILOS™ consists of 3 parts:

- Model
- Predictive Algorithm
- Application

Model
========================================================

We've sampled 15% of supplied twitter, news & blog data, tokenized them all, resulting in >1.4M English tokenized sentences.

These were used as input for the n-gram tokenizer. For accuracy we've generated all 1-grams until 7-grams (as far as possible) of these sentences and generated frequency tables for each unique gram.

We stored these using a lookup part (first n-1 tokens), the so called datum and the suggest part (the n-th gram)

For speed reasons we only kept tokens with frequency > 1 and only the unique lookups, so only 1 suggestion for each lookup combination exists.

The resulting n-grams:


|   | 1-gram| 2-gram| 3-gram| 4-gram| 5-gram| 6-gram| 7-gram|
|:--|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
|#  |      1|  45577| 261794| 229345| 101001|  41964|  23201|
